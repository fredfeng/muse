Available code is often {\it not} the desired code:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Align parameters based on type similarity using ILP (Integer Linear Programming)
\end{compactitem}

Synthesize wrapper code for type conversion:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Use {\sc SyPet} to perform type conversion
\end{compactitem}
