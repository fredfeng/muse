{\sc Hunter} is a next generation code reuse tool that finds, adapts and synthesizes common programs in {\it large corpus}.

Advantages:
\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf \emph{Increase productivity:}} progammers can focus on more creative tasks.
\vspace{-0.05in}
\item {\bf \emph{Decrease buggy code:}} code reuse reduces the likehihood of buggy implementation.
\vspace{-0.05in}
\end{enumerate}

{\it Key ideas} behind {\sc Hunter:}
\begin{compactitem}
\item {Code search}
\item {Interface alignment}
\item {Synthesis of wrapper code}
\end{compactitem}
