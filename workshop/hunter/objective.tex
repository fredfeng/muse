\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf \emph{Increase productivity:}} progammers can focus on more creative tasks.
\item {\bf \emph{Decrease buggy code:}} code reuse reduces the likehihood of buggy implementation.
\end{enumerate}

{\it Key ideas} behind {\sc Hunter:}
\begin{compactitem}
\item {Code search}
\item {Interface alignment}
\item {Synthesis of wrapper code}
